      <div><h1>My Coding Journey</h1></div>
      <div>
        <p>I have spent most of my life playing with computers
          whether I was playing sims, rollecoster tycoon or even toon town,
          I always ended up with the same ending thought process...How in the hell
          do they do this. That mindset has never left me. After highschool just like
          any teenage boy. All I began to think about was football, but then I was introduced
          to the world of Software development (Computer Information Systems). I thought "so you're telling me that all I 
          have to do is play with my laptop and I pass. Sign Me Up!" Obviously that is not what
          happend. To keep this story short, I played football and went through school like anyone else
          towards the end I had a few mental health and finacial problems and dropped out right before I finished my degree.
          After college I spent most of my time working in resturants, but found myself
          coding in my spare time. Eventually it became an itch that I couldnt quite scratch.
          the more I began to learn. The more I began to fall In love with code all over again.
          Finally I am here. After Countless tutorials and online Courses. I am ready. I am ready
          to take on projects, and or a fulltime job to help me advance myself and grow
          as a developer and as a person. Thank You For your time.
